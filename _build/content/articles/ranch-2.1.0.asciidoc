Ranch `2.1.0` has been released!

Ranch 2.1 adds counters for the number of connections
accepted and terminated. They can be used to produce
information about accept or shutdown rates or as a
total number of connections handled by Ranch.

Ranch 2.1 also adds an alarm around the number of
active connections a connection supervisor handles.
When that number is high it is now possible to
automatically perform an action, such as logging
or gracefully shutting down idle connections.

Starting from Ranch 2.1 the `{inet_backend,socket}`
option is accepted for TCP listeners. Ranch tests
now also run with this option enabled. Note that
there are known issues with the socket backend
at this time.

We are providing a
https://github.com/juhlig/prometheus_ranch[Prometheus collector]
as a separate project as well as a
https://github.com/juhlig/prometheus_ranch/blob/master/dashboards/ranch-dashboard.json[Grafana dashboard].

Thanks this time go to Jan Uhlig and Maria Scott
for contributing the alarms and counters as well
as other improvements that went into this release.

Ranch 2.1 requires Erlang/OTP 22 or above and is tested and supported
on Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows.
