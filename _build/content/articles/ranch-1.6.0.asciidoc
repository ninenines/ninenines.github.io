Ranch `1.6.0` has been released!

This release sees the introduction of a suspend/resume
mechanism for the listeners which makes the listener
close the listening socket and stop accepting new
connections. Existing connections continue uninterrupted.

This can be used to update the socket options of the
listener, or to implement a graceful shutdown. To
that end a function has also been added which allows
waiting until connections reach a certain number.

This release also introduces many changes to prepare
for the transition to Ranch 2.0 that will be released
in the coming months. The guide now features a section
listing all upcoming changes in Ranch 2.0.

The manual has been updated to provide a separate
manual page per function and module, just like for
the Gun and Cowboy manuals.

A complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:

These funds are used to pay for additional servers for
testing. A new server was added last month and allows
me to test with additional Linux distributions Alpine,
CentOS and Debian. Thanks in advance!

As usual, feedback is appreciated, and issues or
questions should be sent via Github tickets. Thanks!
