Cowboy `2.6.0` has been released!

Cowboy 2.6 greatly refactored the HTTP/2 code, a large
part of which was moved to Cowlib and is now used by
both the Cowboy server and the Gun client.

A large number of tickets were also closed which
resulted in many bugs fixed and many features and
options added, although some of them are still
experimental.

Of note is the support for the PROXY protocol header
built directly into Cowboy; the ability to use the
sendfile tuple to send files while streaming a
response body (for example you could build a tar
file on the fly); and experimental support for range
requests in the REST and static file handlers,
including an automatic mode that lets you enable
byte range requests to existing handlers with
what's basically a one-liner.

Many options have also been added and many bugs have
been fixed.

A complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:

You can donate to this project via

These funds are used to pay for additional servers for
testing.

As usual, feedback is appreciated, and issues or
questions should be sent via Github tickets. Thanks!
