Cowboy `2.4.0` has been released!

Numerous HTTP/2 options have been added to control
the HTTP/2 SETTINGS and general behavior of HTTP/2
connections. The options for initial window sizes,
maximum frame sizes or compression table sizes
might be of interest for optimizing the performance
of HTTP/2 connections.

Experimental support for Websocket over HTTP/2 was
added. Note that browsers do not currently support
it. The only browser with partial support is Google
Chrome 67 (dev build) started with a specific flag.
As a result it's disabled by default in Cowboy too.

All of Cowboy's RFC7540 tests and all of the h2spec
test suite cases now pass. There are still parts
that are not implemented (the priority mechanisms
for example) and edge cases that are not covered,
however, so the HTTP/2 support can still be improved.

A complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:

These funds are used to pay for additional servers for
testing. A new server was added this month and allows
me to test with additional Linux distributions Alpine,
CentOS and Debian. Thanks in advance!

As usual, feedback is appreciated, and issues or
questions should be sent via Github tickets. Thanks!
