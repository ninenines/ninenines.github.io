In my spare time I have made a rather small contribution to
a game that just released on Steam today:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/661470/The_Gateway_Trilogy/[The Gateway Trilogy].

Play it!

I've written a small Windows program,
https://github.com/essen/steamwrapper[steamwrapper], that
is responsible for unlocking achievements on Steam when
they are unlocked in the game. Due to how the game is written
it's necessary to have a separate program handle this task
and I've volunteered and did the work to make it happen.
The program will most likely end up also used for
https://store.steampowered.com/app/94300/The_Dream_Machine_Chapter_1__2/[The Dream Machine],
which you may already have heard of.

Since half the planet has to stay at home, I figured I would
share this information and offer recommendation for both
games. You won't regret playing them. They offer good puzzles,
weird weirdness and interesting situations. And if you're not
into gaming yourself, they might be good to calm down your
kids. Though reading comprehension is necessary. (If your kids
are too young, try https://store.steampowered.com/app/711660/CHUCHEL/[CHUCHEL]
or https://store.steampowered.com/app/207690/Botanicula/[Botanicula].
If you need more, just ask me directly. I got experience.)

Stay safe!
