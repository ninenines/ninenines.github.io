GitHub will basically

given to me for one year, so now's the best time to
reward my work!

I have replaced all BountySource links with GitHub Sponsors
because GitHub Sponsors will make it easier for me to know
who sponsors my work when responding to issues. We'll see

Head on to my https://github.com/sponsors/essen[GitHub Sponsors] page now!

Thanks.
