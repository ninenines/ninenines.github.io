Ranch `2.2.0` has been released!

Ranch 2.2 is a maintenance release containing a
small number of fixes and improvements.

The key addition in this release is the support
for `DTLS` which has been added to the test suites.

Ranch 2.2 is tested with Erlang/OTP 24.0 onward, although it
should be compatible with Erlang/OTP 22.0 and above. It is
tested and supported on Linux, macOS and Windows, but should
also work on BSD.

A complete list of changes can be found in the migration guide:
https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/ranch/2.1/guide/migrating_from_2.1/[Migrating from Ranch 2.1 to 2.2].

Ranch `1.8.1` was also released to provide
compatibility with OTP-28.
