Cowboy `2.9.0` has been released!

Cowboy 2.9 implements graceful shutdown of connection
processes for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections.

Cowboy 2.9 is the first release to support the much
awaited Erlang/OTP 24 out of the box. While users that
were using Ranch 2.0 already were ready for OTP 24,
the Ranch version used by Cowboy out of the box was
not compatible and had to be updated.

Cowboy 2.9 requires Erlang/OTP 22.0 or greater.
It is tested and supported on Linux, FreeBSD, macOS
and Windows.

A complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:

questions should be sent via Github tickets. Thanks!
