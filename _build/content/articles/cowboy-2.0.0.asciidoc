Cowboy `2.0.0` has been released!

This is the new stable version of Cowboy. There
are no new releases planned for the 1.x version
of Cowboy.

The highlights from the release are:

* HTTP/2 support!

* Websocket compression!

* Much simpler, cleaner interface. No more weird
  errors just because you discard the Req object.

* A new low-level interface that receives all events
  from every set of request and response. This
  replaces the awkward hooks from 1.0.

* https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.0/manual/[A much more detailed manual !]

A more complete list of changes can be found in the
migration guide:
https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.0/guide/migrating_from_1.0/[Migrating from Cowboy 1.0 to 2.0].

There are two planned feature releases after 2.0.
Some features were temporarily removed and will be
added back in 2.1. In 2.2 new features will be added
to allow users to support the gRPC protocol. Full
details https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/milestones[in tickets].
