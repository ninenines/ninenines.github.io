I am proud to announce the pre-release of The Erlanger Playbook.

The Erlanger Playbook is a book about software development using
Erlang. It currently covers all areas from the conception, design,
the writing of code, documentation and tests.

The book is still a work in progress. Future topics will include
refactoring, debugging and tracing, benchmarking, releases, community
management (for open source projects).

The following sections are currently available:

* About this book; Changelog; Future additions
* _Erlang:_ Building blocks; Patterns
* _Workflow:_ Think; Write; Stay productive
* _Documentation:_ On documentation; Tutorials; User guide; Manual; README files
* _Design:_ RESTful APIs; Lessons learned
* _Code:_ Starting a project; Version control; Project structure; Code style; Best practices; Special processes; IOLists; The process dictionary
* _Tests:_ On testing; Success typing analysis; Manual testing; Unit testing; Functional testing
* _Selling Erlang:_ On persuasion; Don't let it crash

The book is currently 180 pages long. The final version
of the book is planned to be between 200 and 250 pages.
A print version of the book will be considered once the final
version gets released. The printed book is *not* included
in the price.

This is a self-published book. The base price is 50€. All proceeds
will be used to allow me to work on open source full time.

There will be a *delay* between payment and sending of the book.
This process is currently manual.

As the book is a pre-release, feedback is more than welcome. You can
send your comments to erlanger@ this website.

The plan is to add content regularly until I run out of things to say.
