Ranch `1.7.0` has been released!

This release adds built-in support for the PROXY protocol.

The PROXY protocol is a simple and efficient way for proxies
to transmit information about the client.

While a third-party library already existed, it was not
entirely compatible with the Ranch interface, in particular
when socket active mode was involved. This new implementation
fixes that and supports the full protocol with as little
overhead as possible compared to normal operations: just one
extra function call.

A complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:

You can donate to this project via

These funds are used to pay for additional servers for
testing and allow to me allocate more days to open source
work. Thanks in advance!

As usual, feedback is appreciated, and issues or
questions should be sent via Github tickets. Thanks!
