Gun `1.2.0` has been released!

Gun is an HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket client
for Erlang/OTP.

Gun now supports issuing CONNECT requests to HTTP
proxies in order to establish tunnels to origin
servers. Gun can establish tunnels over one or
more proxies as necessary.

All existing protocols can be used inside the tunnel,
including HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket over both
TCP and TLS connections.

Note that it is currently not possible to tunnel
a TLS connection via an HTTPS proxy due to
limitations in the current version of Erlang/OTP.

A complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:

You can donate to this project via
https://github.com/sponsors/essen[GitHub Sponsors].
These funds are used to pay for additional servers for
testing. And healthy food.

As usual, feedback is appreciated, and issues or
questions should be sent via Github tickets. Thanks!
