Cowboy, Ranch, Gun and Erlang.mk now have official channels
in the Erlang OSS Discord server. You are welcome to join
to get help with these projects or to plan contributions.
https://discord.gg/x25nNq2fFE[Join Erlang OSS Discord now!]

The Discord server is meant to replace the long discontinued
IRC channel and provide a place where direct interactions
are possible, complementing GitHub tickets.

I have created the Erlang OSS Discord server for my own
purposes, but anyone that has an open source project written
in Erlang or fully usable from Erlang is welcome to join
and request a channel for their project.

Note that the unofficial #cowboy channel on Erlang Slack
is not monitored so posting questions there is discouraged.

Looking forward to future discussions!
