Cowboy `2.1.0` has been released!

This release focused on adding features that were temporarily
removed during the 2.0 release process:

* The client TLS certificate can now be obtained.

* The 100 Continue response is now sent automatically
  again when necessary.

* NEW: It is now possible to send informational
  responses (1XX) directly from user code via the
  `cowboy_req:inform/2,3` functions.

* NEW: `cowboy_rest` handlers can now switch to any
  other type of handler from almost any callback. This
  is especially useful to switch to `cowboy_loop` to
  stream the request or response body.

A number of bugs have also been fixed. A more complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:
https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.1/guide/migrating_from_2.0/[Migrating from Cowboy 2.0 to 2.1].

The next release will see the added support for trailers,
which are necessary for implementing the gRPC protocol.

Thanks in advance!
