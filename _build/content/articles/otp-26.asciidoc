Erlang/OTP 26 will soon be released by OTP team and
unfortunately broke the compilation of Cowlib, which
is a dependency for both Cowboy and Gun.

Users willing to upgrade to Erlang/OTP 26 or above
will therefore need to ensure that they use the
right version of Cowboy or Gun. The versions that
first supported Erlang/OTP 26 are as follow:

* Cowboy 2.10.0
* Gun 2.0.1
* Cowlib 2.12.1

A small number of fixes has also been made at the
same time but the main change is support for
Erlang/OTP 26.

As usual, feedback is appreciated, and issues or
questions should be sent via Github tickets. Thanks!
