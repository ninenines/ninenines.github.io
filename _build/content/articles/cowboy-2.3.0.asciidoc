Cowboy `2.3.0` has been released!

This release focused on adding support for the functions
from the `sys` module for introspecting Cowboy processes.

Many bugs have also been fixed. A more complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:
https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.3/guide/migrating_from_2.2/[Migrating from Cowboy 2.2 to 2.3].

You can donate to this project via
https://github.com/sponsors/essen[GitHub Sponsors]
because I need to eat snacks when I write code.
Thanks in advance!

As usual, feedback is appreciated, and issues
should be reported by opening a ticket. Thanks!
