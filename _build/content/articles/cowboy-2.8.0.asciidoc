Cowboy `2.8.0` has been released!

Cowboy 2.8 contains many optimizations for all
protocols. HTTP/1.1 has received the largest
improvements and Cowboy will now be able to
handle noticeably more requests. Thanks to
the folks at https://stressgrid.com/[Stressgrid] for helping identify that
the performance was lower than it should have been
and for benchmarking my many changes and experiments.

Cowboy 2.8 also contains a small number of tweaks
and bug fixes. Cowboy 2.8 is the first Cowboy release,
ever, to be consistently green on all tested platforms.
This is mostly due to the reworking of some test cases,
but a few bugs were discovered and fixed in the process.

Cowboy 2.8 requires Erlang/OTP 22.0 or greater. It may
also work out of the box with Erlang/OTP 21.3 but this
was not tested and is not supported. It is tested
and supported on Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows.

A complete
list of changes can be found in the migration guide:
https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.8/guide/migrating_from_2.7/[Migrating from Cowboy 2.7 to 2.8].

I have free time available for consulting or for
paid open source development at the moment. If you
are interested, drop me an email at mailto:contact@ninenines.eu[contact@ninenines.eu].
I have gathered that there's interest in a pure Erlang GRPC
implementation, and there's also QUIC and HTTP/3 that will
be ready soon, for examples of projects I'd be interested in
working on.

You can donate to this project via

These funds are used to pay for additional servers for
testing. Corporate sponsorship options are also available,
please contact me directly!

As usual, feedback is appreciated, and issues or
questions should be sent via Github tickets. Thanks!
