== Migrating from Gun 1.1 to 1.2

Gun 1.2 adds support for the CONNECT request over HTTP/1.1
connections.

== Features added

* CONNECT requests can now be issued on HTTP/1.1 connections.
  The tunneled connection can use any of the protocols Gun
  supports: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket over both TCP and
  TLS transports. Note that Gun currently does not support
  tunneling a TLS connection over a TLS connection due to
  limitations in Erlang/OTP.

* Gun supports sending multiple CONNECT requests, allowing
  the tunnel to the origin server to go through multiple
  proxies.

* Gun supports sending CONNECT requests with authorization
  credentials using the Basic authentication mechanism.

* Update Cowlib to 2.6.0

== Functions added

* The functions `gun:connect/2,3,4` have been added. They can
  be used to initiate CONNECT requests on HTTP/1.1 connections.
