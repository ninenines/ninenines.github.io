		<p>Ranch 1.3.0 has been released!
This release fixes a number of long standing issues and addsa small number of features:
The ssl application has been added to the list of dependencies.If you don&#8217;t need it, you can remove it automatically when fetchingRanch or when building the release. If you do need it, you will nolonger have issues shutting down a node because of Ranch.</p>

If you need help with a project, consider either opening a ticketon that project&#8217;s issues tracker or going through the communitychannels (erlang-questions, #ninenines or #erlang on Freenode).
Prefer tickets; often when people have issues it highlights anunderlying problem in the project or its documentation.</p>

		<p>Last week-end I updated the Nine Nines website.
I switched to Hugo. The site isnow built from Asciidocdocuments. You probably saw me switch to Asciidocfor documentation this past year. This is thenatural conclusion to that story. The great thingis that with a little bit of Makefile magic I canjust copy the documentation files into Hugo andpoof, they appear on the website.
I am very happy with that new setup.</p>

		<p>An update to The Erlanger Playbook is now available!
The Erlanger Playbook is a book about software development usingErlang. It currently covers all areas from the conception, design,the writing of code, documentation and tests.
The book is still a work in progress. Future topics will includerefactoring, debugging and tracing, benchmarking, releases, communitymanagement (for open source projects).
This update fixes a number of things and adds two chapters: IOlistsand Erlang building blocks.</p>

		<p>Yesterday I pushed Websocket permessage-deflate toCowboy master. I also pushedachange in the way the code validates UTF-8 data(required for text and close frames as per the spec).
When looking into why the permessage-deflate testsin autobahntestsuite were taking such a long time, Ifound that autobahn is using an adaptation of thealgorithm named Flexibleand Economical UTF-8 Decoder. This is the C99implementation:

		<p>Last week I read a great articleoncontributing to open source by Alvaro Videla. He makesmany great points and I am in agreement with most of it.This made me want to properly explain my point of view withregard to open source and contributions. Unlike most opensource evangelism articles I will not talk about ideals orany of that crap, but rather my personal feelings andexperience.</p>

		<p>As I am away from home with little to do (some call thisa vacation) I wanted to reflect a little on the story so far,or how I arrived to Erlang and got to where I am now. Theraw personal experience. It&#8217;ll be an article that&#8217;s moreabout social aspect, communities and marketing a project thantechnical considerations. As a period piece, it will alsoallow me to reflect on the evolution of Erlang in recentyears.</p>

		<p>Now that Cowboy 1.0 is out, I can spend some of my time thinkingabout Cowboy 2.0 that will be released soon after Erlang/OTP 18.0.This entry discusses the proposed changes to query string handlingin Cowboy.
Cowboy 2.0 will respond to user wishes by simplifying the interfaceof the cowboy_req module. Users want two things: lessjuggling with the Req variable, and more maps. Maps is the onlydynamic key/value data structure in Erlang that we can match directlyto extract values, allowing users to greatly simplify their code asthey don&#8217;t need to call functions to do everything anymore.</p>

		<p>I will now be regularly writing posts about project status, plansand hopes for the future.
Before that though, there&#8217;s one important news to share.
Until a year ago all development was financed through consultingand development services. This worked alright but too much time wasspent doing things that didn&#8217;t benefit the open source projects.And that didn&#8217;t make me happy at all. Because I like being happyI stopped that for the most part and spent the year figuring thingsout, experimenting and discussing with people about it.</p>

		<p>This was a triumph! I&#8217;m making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS!!
It&#8217;s hard to overstate my satisfaction. Thanks to everyone whomade this possible.
If you have backed this fundraiser, and haven&#8217;t provided yourpersonal details yet, please do so quickly so that your rewardscan be sent!
I am hoping that we will be able to make good use of all thatmoney. The details of the expenses will be published regularlyon the 2013 Fundraiser wiki page,giving you full disclosure as to how your money is used.</p>

		<p>Building OTP releases has always been a difficult task. Tools likeReltool or Rebar have made this simpler, butit&#8217;s no panacea. This article will show you an alternative andhopefully much simpler solution.
There is two steps to building a release. First you need to buildthe various OTP applications you want to include in the release. Oncedone, you need to create the release itself, by including the Erlangruntime system alongside the applications, a boot script to start thenode and all its applications, and some configuration files.</p>

		<p>Today we will start the work on the intermediate modulethat will be used to run the code for the expressions foundin our file&#8217;s body, replacing our interpreter.
This is what we want to have when all the work is done:
xerl -&gt; tokens -&gt; AST -&gt; intermediate -&gt; cerlToday we will perform this work only on the atomic integerexpression however, so we will not build any module at the end.</p>

		<p>As promised we are adding an expression separator this time.This will be short and easy.
In the tokenizer we only need to add a line recognizing thecomma as a valid token.
, : {token, {',', TokenLine}}.Then we need to change the following lines in the parser:
exprs -&gt; expr : ['$1'].exprs -&gt; expr exprs : ['$1' | '$2'].And add a comma between the expressions on the second line:</p>

		<p>I would like to share some experience and theories onErlang scalability.
This will be in the form of a series of hints, whichmay or may not be accompanied with explanations as to whythings are this way, or how they improve or reduce the scalabilityof a system. I will try to do my best to avoid giving falsehoods,even if that means a few things won&#8217;t be explained.</p>

		<p>We will be adding atomic integer expressions to our language.These look as follow in Erlang:
42.And the result of this expression is of course 42.
We will be running this expression at compile time, since wedon&#8217;t have the means to run code at runtime yet. This will ofcourse result in no module being compiled, but that&#8217;s OK, it willallow us to discuss a few important things we&#8217;ll have to plan forlater on.</p>

		</header>

		<p>Everything is an expression.
This sentence carries profound meaning. We will invoke it manytimes over the course of these articles.
If everything is an expression, then the language shouldn&#8217;t haveany problem with me defining two modules in the same source file.
mod first_modulebeginendmod second_modulebeginendLikewise, it shouldn&#8217;t have any problem with me defining amodule inside another module.
mod out_modulebeginmod in_modulebeginendendOf course, in the context of the Erlang VM, these two snippetsare equivalent; there is nothing preventing you from calling thein_module module from any other module.</p>

		<p>Let&#8217;s build a programming language. I call it Xerl: eXtended ERLang.It&#8217;ll be an occasion for us to learn a few things, especially me.
Unlike in Erlang, in this language, everything is an expression.This means that modules and functions are expression, and indeed thatyou can have more than one module per file.
We are just starting, so let&#8217;s no go ahead of ourselves here. We&#8217;llbegin with writing the code allowing us to compile an empty module.</p>

		<p>Last week I was speaking at theLondon Erlang Factory Litewhere I presented a live demonstration of building an FTP server usingRanch.As there was no slide, you should use this article as a reference instead.
The goal of this article is to showcase how to use Ranch for writinga network protocol implementation, how Ranch gets out of the way to letyou write the code that matters, and the common techniques used whenwriting servers.</p>

		<p>Everyone knows Tic Tac Toe,right?
Players choose either to be the Xs or the Os, then place their symbolon a 3x3 board one after another, trying to create a line of 3 of them.
Writing an algorithm to check for victory sounds easy, right? It&#8217;seasily tested, considering there&#8217;s only 8 possible winning rows (3 horizontal,3 vertical and 2 diagonal).
In Erlang though, you probably wouldn&#8217;t want an algorithm.</p>
