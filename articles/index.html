		<p>Ranch 2.1.0 has been released!
Ranch 2.1 adds counters for the number of connections accepted and terminated. They can be used to produce information about accept or shutdown rates or as a total number of connections handled by Ranch.
Ranch 2.1 also adds an alarm around the number of active connections a connection supervisor handles. When that number is high it is now possible to automatically perform an action, such as logging or gracefully shutting down idle connections.</p>

		<p>Cowboy 2.9.0 has been released!
Cowboy 2.9 implements graceful shutdown of connection processes for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections.
Cowboy 2.9 is the first release to support the much awaited Erlang/OTP 24 out of the box. While users that were using Ranch 2.0 already were ready for OTP 24, the Ranch version used by Cowboy out of the box was not compatible and had to be updated.
Cowboy 2.9 requires Erlang/OTP 22.</p>

		<p>Ranch 2.0.0 has been released!
In Ranch 1.x, there is only one supervisor per Ranch listener to start and manage connection processes. Under high load (many clients rapidly connecting and/or disconnecting), the message queue of this one supervisor could become congested, leading to declining accept rates or a stalled listener.
Ranch 2.0 introduces the num_conns_sups option (defaulting to the number of acceptors), which allows the message load to be divided between the specified number of connection supervisors.</p>

		<p>Cowboy 2.8.0 has been released!
Cowboy 2.8 contains many optimizations for all protocols. HTTP/1.1 has received the largest improvements and Cowboy will now be able to handle noticeably more requests. Thanks to the folks at Stressgrid for helping identify that the performance was lower than it should have been and for benchmarking my many changes and experiments.
Cowboy 2.8 also contains a small number of tweaks and bug fixes. Cowboy 2.</p>

		<p>In my spare time I have made a rather small contribution to a game that just released on Steam today: The Gateway Trilogy.
Play it!
I&apos;ve written a small Windows program, steamwrapper, that is responsible for unlocking achievements on Steam when they are unlocked in the game. Due to how the game is written it&apos;s necessary to have a separate program handle this task and I&apos;ve volunteered and did the work to make it happen.</p>

		<p>Hope everyone had a great year. Let&apos;s take a look at what happened and what&apos;s coming.
2019 has been the year of pre-releases with Ranch 2.0 and Gun 2.0 getting close to completion. I hope both of them will be out in the first half of 2020. They were supposed to be released in 2019, but I guess that was a bit optimistic. Ranch 2.0 is a big performance improvement if you need to quickly open a large amount of connections (but you probably don&apos;t), while Gun 2.</p>

GitHub will basically double the funds given to me for one year, so now&apos;s the best time to reward my work!
I have replaced all BountySource links with GitHub Sponsors because GitHub Sponsors will make it easier for me to know who sponsors my work when responding to issues. We&apos;ll see how that goes.

		<p>Cowboy 2.7.0 has been released!
Cowboy 2.7 improves the HTTP/2 code with optimizations around the sending of DATA and WINDOW_UPDATE frames; graceful shutdown of the connection when the client is going away; and rate limiting mechanisms. New options and mechanisms have also been added to control the amount of memory Cowboy ends up using with both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Much of this work was done to address HTTP/2 CVEs about potential denial of service.</p>

Before listing the features please note that this pre-release includes a fix for a potential security vulnerability! This only applies when Gun is used inside a proxy under specific circumstances. Please see the migration guide for details. Since the issue also exists in the previous version I have released Gun 1.</p>

		<p>Ranch 2.0.0-rc.1 has been released!
We are getting very close to releasing Ranch 2.0! As most of the tremendous programming work was done by contributor Jan Uhlig, I will yield the floor and let him describe what went into this great release.
In Ranch 1.x, there is only one supervisor per Ranch listener to start and manage connection processes. Under high load (many clients rapidly connecting and/or disconnecting), the message queue of this one supervisor could become congested, leading to declining accept rates or a stalled listener.</p>

		<p>Joe Armstrong passed away a couple months ago. This was a sad day, completely unexpected to me, and he will be sorely missed.
Great eulogies were written.
My most striking memory of Joe was during dinner at his place after a conference in Stockholm many years ago. Joe was describing his rubber duck debugging method and introduced us to his famous rubber duck.
&quot;When you can&apos;t figure it out, ask the duck!</p>

		<p>As the year 2018 ends it&apos;s time for a short recap and a look forward for the next year.
Overall, more than half of all open tickets have been closed. Most tickets were opened since 2015 and I couldn&apos;t get to those, but now that pre-school started I have a lot more time! I&apos;m aiming to keep the number of tickets below 100 across all my projects.
Cowboy 2.x is now mature.</p>

		</header>

		<p>Cowboy 2.6.0 has been released!
Cowboy 2.6 greatly refactored the HTTP/2 code, a large part of which was moved to Cowlib and is now used by both the Cowboy server and the Gun client.
A large number of tickets were also closed which resulted in many bugs fixed and many features and options added, although some of them are still experimental.
Of note is the support for the PROXY protocol header built directly into Cowboy; the ability to use the sendfile tuple to send files while streaming a response body (for example you could build a tar file on the fly); and experimental support for range requests in the REST and static file handlers, including an automatic mode that lets you enable byte range requests to existing handlers with what&apos;s basically a one-liner.</p>

		<p>Ranch 1.7.0 has been released!
This release adds built-in support for the PROXY protocol.
The PROXY protocol is a simple and efficient way for proxies to transmit information about the client.
While a third-party library already existed, it was not entirely compatible with the Ranch interface, in particular when socket active mode was involved. This new implementation fixes that and supports the full protocol with as little overhead as possible compared to normal operations: just one extra function call.</p>

		<p>Cowboy 2.5.0 has been released!
Cowboy 2.5 focused on making the test suites pass. It is now possible to get all the Cowboy tests to pass successfully, at least on Linux and on the more recent Erlang/OTP versions.
HTTP/1.1 has been improved with a fix for the TCP reset problem and the ability to stream a response body without using chunked transfer-encoding.
Two functions have been added: cowboy_req:stream_events/3 encodes and streams one or more text/event-stream events, and cowboy_req:read_and_match_urlencoded_body/2,3 reads, parses and matches application/x-www-form-urlencoded request bodies.</p>

Gun is an HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket client for Erlang/OTP.
This release improves the CONNECT support introduced in the previous version and adds built-in Websocket protocol negotiation.
A complete list of changes can be found in the migration guide: Migrating from Gun 1.2 to 1.3.
