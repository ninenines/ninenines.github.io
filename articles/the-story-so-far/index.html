<div class="paragraph"><p>As I am away from home with little to do (some call this
a vacation) I wanted to reflect a little on the story so far,
or how I arrived to Erlang and got to where I am now. The
raw personal experience. It&#8217;ll be an article that&#8217;s more
about social aspect, communities and marketing a project than
technical considerations. As a period piece, it will also
allow me to reflect on the evolution of Erlang in recent
years.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once upon a time-- Okay this isn&#8217;t a fairy tale. The story
begins with a short chapter in 2010. The year 2010 started
with a fairly major event in my life: the US servers for the
online game I stopped playing a few months before, but was
still involved with through its community, were closing. OMG!
Someone found a way to log packets and started working on a
private server; meanwhile the JP servers were still up. And
that&#8217;s pretty much it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Fast forward a few months and it became pretty clear that
the private server was going nowhere considering all the drama
surrounding it-- which is actually not unusual, but it was
more entertaining than average and the technical abilities of
people running the project were obviously lacking so I decided
to obtain those logged packets and look at things myself. I
didn&#8217;t want to do a private server yet, I only wanted to take
a peek to see how things worked, and perhaps organize some
effort to document the protocol.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There was 10GB of logs. I didn&#8217;t have an easy to use
language to analyze them, and hex editors wouldn&#8217;t cut it for
most purposes, so I had to look elsewhere. This was a good
opportunity to start learning this PHP killer I read about
before, which also happens to feature syntax for matching
binaries, called Erlang. To be perfectly honest I wouldn&#8217;t
have touched the logs if I didn&#8217;t have the added motivation
to play with and learn a new language.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At the time it was pretty hard to learn Erlang. In my
experience there was Joe&#8217;s book (which I always recommend
first as I believe it is the best to learn the Erlang side
of things; but falls a little short on OTP), and there was
about 5 chapters of LYSE. There were a couple other books
I never managed to get into (sorry guys), and there was also
a few interesting blogs, some of which I can&#8217;t find anymore.
Finally the #erlang IRC community was there but I was strictly
lurking at the time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What a difference compared to 4 years later! (That&#8217;s
today, by the way!) Now we have more books than I can
remember, tons of articles covering various aspects of the
language and platform, many targeting beginners but a good
number of them also about advanced topics. We even have a
free online book, LYSE, with more than 30 chapters covering
pretty much everything. Needless to say I never finished
reading LYSE as it got written slower than I learnt.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Back to 2010. I wrote a parser for the logs, and
aggregated those results into one CSV file per packet type
so I could open them in Gnumeric and aggregate some more,
but manually this time, and draw conclusions on the packet
structures. That was pretty easy. Even for a beginner.
Anyone can go from zero to that level in a day or two.
Then, having mastered binary pattern matching, I wanted
to learn some more Erlang, by making this aggregation
faster. What I had done before worked, but I wasn&#8217;t going
to wait forever to process everything sequentially. So I
looked and found a project called <code>plists</code> (still exists,
but not maintained AFAIK). I downloaded that project and
replaced my <code>lists:</code> calls to <code>plists:</code>.
Boom. In just a few minutes all logs were processed, and
I had learnt something new.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is particularly interesting to note that the lack of
a package manager or index never bothered me. Neither before
nor after learning Erlang. My experience with package
managers was mostly related to Ubuntu, a little Perl and
Python, and PHP&#8217;s Pear. Let&#8217;s just stay polite and say it
was always a terrible experience. So searching on the Web
didn&#8217;t feel awkward, because even if I used a tool or
website I would have ended up doing a search or two anyway.
This is in contrast to the package index feature in
<a href="https://github.com/ninenines/erlang.mk">Erlang.mk</a>,
which is meant to simplify specifying dependencies more
than anything: <code>DEPS = cowboy</code>. It does not
attempt to solve any other problem, and will only attempt
to solve one extra problem in the near future, which is
the discovery of packages. So expect some kind of website
listing packages soon enough.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I want to use this parenthese to also point out that at
the time there was a very small number of projects out there,
at least compared to today. While you sometimes hear people
complain about lack of certain libraries, it is so much
better now than it was before! The situation improves very
quickly, so much that it&#8217;s not going to be that big an issue
soon enough.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Wanting to know more about that game&#8217;s protocol, in the
year 2010, I ended up starting to write more Erlang code to
simulate a server and use the server to query the client and
see what was happening, documenting the packets and so on.
This eventually lead to a larger project implementing more
and more until people got their hopes up for a revival of
the game, all the while the now competing original server
project died in a stream of drama and technical incompetence.
Of course, I ended up doing what any good Internet citizen
would do, I crushed people&#8217;s hopes, but that&#8217;s not important
to our story. The important part is that before giving up
on this project, I not only learnt a good deal of Erlang
and a little deal of OTP (which I did not touch until 6
months after I started with Erlang; see the paragraph
about learning material above), but I also had an intriguing
idea pop into my mind for what would become my greatest
success yet.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The giving up part was not easy. Having had financial
difficulties all year 2010 and part of 2009, I resolved
to travel back to Paris to try and make it. I ended up
sleeping in offices for 6 months, being hosted by a shady
person, and hearing my fair share of stories about
the dark side of business. While there I also worked for
another company with someone who would end up becoming
another high profile Erlang developer. The situation
slowly improved, I started taking part in the #erlang
IRC discussions, giving up my status of lurker and, a
few months into 2011, started working on the Apache killer
project: Cowboy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the part where I probably should get accused of
racism and other fun things, but I never did. And I think
that speaks lots about the Erlang community. In all my time
writing Erlang code, I can count the number of conflicts I
had with other people on a single hand. This is the nicest
programming community I have ever seen, by far. And the
humblest too. The Erlang community feels like Japan. And
I love Japan. So I love the Erlang community. I can&#8217;t say
this enough. This is something that stayed true for all
my time using Erlang, and despite the rise of alternative
languages that are not Japan the Erlang community has
remained very Japan.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first published version of Cowboy was written in
two weeks. A little before those two weeks, during, and
a while after, pretty much everything I said on the
Internets was that Cowboy was going to be the greatest
HTTP server ever, that the other servers were problematic
(and just to be clear, Yaws was rarely if ever mentioned,
due to being in a perceived different league of "full
featured servers" while Cowboy was a "lightweight server"),
and that Cowboy will be the best replacement to a Mochiweb
or Misultin application. This, alongside a lot of time
spent on IRC telling people to use Cowboy when they were
asking for an HTTP server to use, probably made me sound
very annoying. But it worked, and Cowboy started getting
its first users, despite being only a few weeks old. Of
course, as soon as I got my very first user, I started
claiming Cowboy had "a lot of users".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Looking back today I would definitely find myself annoying,
this wasn&#8217;t just an idle comment there. For about a year,
maybe a little more, all I ever said was that Cowboy was
the best. This probably made me a little dumber in the
process (as if I wasn&#8217;t enough! I know). Being French, I
sometimes would also say things quite abruptly. To stay
polite, I probably sounded like an asshole. I learnt to
stop being so French over time thankfully.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I think what was most important to Cowboy at the time,
was three things. First, it felt fresh. It was new, had new
ideas, tried to do things differently and followed "new" old
best practices (the OTP way-- which was simply too obscure
for most people at the time). Second, it had me spending
all my time telling people to use it whenever they were
looking for an HTTP server. Third, it had me helping people
get started with it and guide them all the steps of the way.
Mostly because it didn&#8217;t have a very good documentation, but
still, hand holding does wonders.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To be able to help people every time they had a problem,
I did not spend all my days reading IRC. Instead I simply
made sure to be notified when someone said <code>cowboy</code>.
The same way many people subscribe to alerts when their
company is mentioned in the news. Nothing fancy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Time went on, Cowboy grew, or as some like to say,
completely destroyed the competition, and many people
eventually moved from Mochiweb and Misultin to Cowboy.
And then Roberto Ostinelli stopped Misultin development
and told everyone to move to Cowboy. This is the most
humble and selfless act I have ever seen in the programming
sphere, and I only have one thing to say about it: GG.
Thanks for the fish. He left me with the tasks of improving
Cowboy examples, documentation and strongly believed that
the Misultin interface was more user friendly out of all
the servers. So I added many examples, as many lines of
documentation as we have of code, and strongly believe
that Cowboy 2.0 will be the most user friendly interface
out of all servers. But only time will tell.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With the rise of the project and the rise in the number
of users, my previous strategy (completely incidental, by
the way, and definitely not a well thought out plan to
become popular) stopped working. It was taking me too much
time. The important aspects slowly drifted. If I wanted to
support more users, I would have to spend less time with
each individual user. This was actually a hard problem.
You basically have to make people understand they can&#8217;t
just come to you directly when they have a problem, they
have to follow proper channels. It becomes less personal,
and might be felt like you don&#8217;t care about them anymore.
You have to hurt some people&#8217;s feelings at this point. It
is quite unfortunate, and also quite difficult to do. There
is some unwritten rule that says early adopters deserve
more, but in the real world it never works like this. So
I probably hurt some people&#8217;s feelings at some point. But
that&#8217;s okay. Because even if you make sure to be as nice
as possible when you tell people to go through proper
channels from now on, some people will still get offended.
There&#8217;s nothing you can do about it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>From that point onward the important points about the
project was getting the documentation done, making sure
people knew about the proper channels to get help and
report issues, etc. Basically making myself less needed.
This is quite a contrast with the first days, but I believe
Cowboy made that transition successfully.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Not only did I win time by not having to hold hands with
everyone all the time (not that I didn&#8217;t like it, but you
know, the sweat), but I also won time thanks to the increased
project popularity. Indeed, the more users you have, the more
annoying guys there are to tell people to use your project
and that it&#8217;s the best and everything. Which is great. At
least, it&#8217;s great if you don&#8217;t pay too much attention to it.
Sometimes people will give an advice that is, in your opinion,
a bad advice. And that&#8217;s okay. Don&#8217;t intervene every time
someone gives a bad advice, learn to let it go. People will
figure it out. You learn by making mistakes, after all. Use
this extra time to make sure other people don&#8217;t end up
giving the same bad advice instead. Fix the code or the
documentation that led to this mistake. Slowly improve the
project and make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is my story. So far, anyway.</p></div>
